A basic app that will configure the closest COVID-19 testing site on the UW-Campus (Fall 2020) using Dijkstra's algorighm

App will ask users for the day of the week they want to be tested and their location. With this information we will then be able to recommend the closest testing centers open that day. This program would mainly be utilized by UW-Madison students/faculty/staff and people living near campus.

This program was for a project for CS400 at UW-Madison

Utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm as well as a makefile and junit testing
